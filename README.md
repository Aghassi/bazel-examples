# Aspect Bazel Examples

This variety of examples demonstrate how a large polyglot monorepo is configured with [Bazel](https://bazel.build).
It's intended for Developer Infrastructure and Build systems experts to study solutions to problems at scale.

- Just looking for a smaller Bazel repo as a playground? Run `aspect init` to create an empty project with the languages and features you care about. See <https://docs.aspect.build/guides/getting-started/>.
- Want to see another solution illustrated in an example? You can sponsor that by contributing a feature bounty to <https://opencollective.com/aspect-build>.
- We offer paid support for common Bazel migrations: <https://aspect.build/services>
